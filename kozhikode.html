					Situated on the Malabar coast and endowed with natural beauty, Kozhikode beach should be a must in the itinerary of your visit to the city. This beach is renowned for the sunsets that tourists throng here to enjoy. Though the water is muddy and not suitable for swimming, still the stunning view of the Arabian Sea that the lighthouse offers more than compensates for the shortcoming.

Payannakal, Putiyappa, Elathur, Beypore, all these beaches are part of the long stretch of Kozhikode beach. This beach lies on the western side of the city and is easily accessible through the four roads in the city.

You can take in the vast expanse of rich golden sand, coconut trees that dot the coastline or the stone bridge known as Pulimoodu, which builds a pathway into the sea. There is never a dull moment at the beach and you can pamper yourself in a refreshing Ayurveda massage.

				<p style="color: white;">
					Enjoy the breathtaking beauty of Thusharagiri Fall when you pay a visit to Kozhikode.  Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet at this point to create the Chalipuzzha River. The river further trifurcates to create three waterfalls and the free-falling water creates a mist, thus giving the name “Thusharagiri”.

This place has a lovely view all around and you get plenty of activities to indulge in. You may go for trekking, or enjoy rock-climbing. You can also take a break to visit the wildlife sanctuaries or sit on the banks of the river to enjoy the waterfalls. The lush green forest and cool water of the streams all around add to your enjoyment. A word of caution though, people with a faint heart should avoid the place because it is nature at its wildest best.  This is a place to awaken the nature lover and wildlife enthusiast in you.

				<p style="color: white;">
					Kakkayam Dam is a famous picnic spot around Kozhikode because of its scenic beauty and plenty of choices for outdoor activities.
